My garage door stopped working on Sunday night. I called and left a message with AJ&#8217;s Garage Door Repair explaining the situation. I got a call back first thing on Monday morning, and they were out within an hour to get things fixed. The price was a lot lower than what my neighbor told me to expect to pay, so I was very happy. Thanks guys!"</p><div style="float:right;"><img src="https://www.ajsgaragedoorservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/more-coverage-on-great-Tucson-garage-door-repair-263x300.jpg" alt="news coverage of great Tucson garage door service by AJ's Garage Doors" width="263" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" srcset="https://www.ajsgaragedoorservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/more-coverage-on-great-Tucson-garage-door-repair-263x300.jpg 263w, https://www.ajsgaragedoorservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/more-coverage-on-great-Tucson-garage-door-repair.jpg" /></div><p>Google Local Guides are considered an informal authority on the area that they live in, as Google only bestows the status upon power users of Google Reviews who sign up and contribute meaningfully to the program. Such guides are meant to enhance the local experience for other online searchers in the area by adding and improving listings on Google Maps. As Google's Local Guide status is awarded based on certain requirements, receiving a stamp of approval from such a guide is a good sign for any local businesses.</p><p>Andrew Johns, owner and representative of AJ&#8217;s Garage Door Service of Tucson, says, "AJ's is a small company that is looking to serve all the residents of Tucson, and it really means a lot to us when a customer takes the time to write a review after we've completed a job for them. We appreciate that Reyna took the time to let others know about her experience. We work hard to provide a <a href="https://www.ajsgaragedoorservice.com/tucson-garage-door-repair-company-receives-excellent-reviews/">fast, affordable garage door service</a> but there are a lot of choices in Tucson when it comes to garage door repairs. We need to stand out—and there is no better way to prove our commitment to helping the community than to have a valued customer leave an honest, positive review."</p><p>AJ's provides a wide variety of <a href="https://ajsgaragedoorserviceoftucson.business.site/posts/2507417145655153207">garage door-related services</a>, including but not limited to full service garage door repairs, garage door opener installation and repairs, repair of broken overhead garage door springs or ​broken garage door cables, and realignment of off-track doors. The company also provides complete door rebuilds, if the situation calls for it.</p><p>Johns says, "At AJ's, our foremost priority is to provide a professional, personal, and affordable garage door service. We understand how stressful it can be when your garage door stops working properly, which is why we strive to help you the same day you call, if that is possible. Our services are thorough. We take the time to listen to the problems you&#8217;re having with your garage door and run a full diagnosis of its mechanical aspects. Before we do anything else, however, we make sure you understand what the problems are and explain the situation to you in simple English, along with our recommended steps to fix it. However, it is up to you to decide what you want to do. We aren't looking to exclusively push our most expensive services. We diagnose, educate, and give you options so that you can make an informed choice regarding your property."</p><p>AJ&#8217;s Garage Door Service of Tucson's commitment to their customers and dedication to their craft is evident in their reviews. Another 5-Star Google review by Bill Posch reads, "Very professional, very friendly, and very affordable. What more could you ask for in a garage door repair service company? They not only answered their phone (which doesn&#8217;t seem like a big deal, but I had to try a few companies before I got a live answer), they were informative on the phone, and managed to schedule me the same day—on a Saturday—and the bill was still less than I anticipated. Would definitely recommend AJ&#8217;s."</p><p>Those interested in learning more about AJ&#8217;s Garage Door Service of Tucson and the services they provide can find more information on the company's website.
